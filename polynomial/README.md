# B2B Membership Zero-Knowledge Proof System

A privacy-preserving membership verification system for B2B organizations using zero-knowledge proofs. This project enables organizations to verify business relationships without revealing sensitive membership information.

## 🔒 Privacy-First Architecture

This system uses polynomial-based zero-knowledge proofs to verify organizational membership while maintaining complete privacy of member identities and organizational structures.

### Key Features

-   **Zero-Knowledge Membership Verification**: Prove membership without revealing identity
-   **KYC Integration**: Enforce compliance requirements through cryptographic proofs
-   **Verification Caching**: Nullifiers enable efficient re-verification by caching previous results
-   **Polynomial-Based Security**: Mathematically sound membership verification using polynomial roots
-   **Scalable Batching**: Support unlimited members through independent polynomial batches
-   **On-Chain Verification**: Decentralized proof verification with smart contract integration

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Polynomial Generation**: Organizations generate polynomials where member secrets are roots
2. **Batch Management**: Members are organized into batches of up to 2047 users per polynomial
3. **Hash Commitment**: Polynomial hashes are published on-chain for integrity verification
4. **ZK Circuit**: Noir-based circuit for generating membership proofs
5. **Nullifier System**: Enables efficient verification caching to avoid redundant proof checks
6. **KYC Integration**: Cryptographic enforcement of compliance requirements

### Cryptographic Primitives

-   **Hash Function**: Poseidon2 for efficient zk-SNARK operations
-   **Polynomial Evaluation**: Efficient computation up to degree 2047 per batch
-   **Batch Scaling**: Independent polynomial equations for unlimited membership growth
-   **Nullifier Generation**: Deterministic verification cache identifiers
-   **Commitment Scheme**: Hash-based polynomial commitments

## 🚀 Scalability Architecture

### Batch-Based Scaling

The system overcomes the 128-user polynomial degree limit through intelligent batching:

-   **Batch Size**: Each batch supports up to 128 members
-   **Independent Polynomials**: Each batch has its own polynomial equation
-   **Unlimited Growth**: Organizations can create multiple batches as needed
-   **Batch Identification**: Users are assigned to specific batches during registration

### Scaling Benefits

-   **Linear Scalability**: Add new batches without affecting existing ones
-   **Proof Efficiency**: Each proof only requires the user's specific batch polynomial
-   **Storage Optimization**: Only relevant batch data needed for verification
-   **Parallel Processing**: Multiple batches can be processed independently

## 📋 System Workflow

### Organization Setup

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Start: Create Organization] --> B{Salt Provided?}
    B -- Yes --> C[Use Admin Provided Salt]
    B -- No --> D[System Autogenerates Salt]
    C --> E[Organization Created with Unique Salt]
    D --> E[Organization Created with Unique Salt]
    E --> F[End]
```

### Member Registration

```mermaid

    A[Start: Add User to Organization] --> B[Generate Secret = hash -> user_email + salt]
    B --> C[Insert User into Batch]
    C --> D[Create/Update Batch Equation]
    D --> E[Emit On-chain Event with Batch Info + Polynomial Hash]
    E --> F[End]
```

**Note**: The batching system automatically handles scalability - when a batch reaches 128 members, new users are placed into a new batch with its own independent polynomial equation. This allows organizations to support unlimited members while maintaining efficient proof generation.

### Proof Generation & Verification

    D --> E[Fetch Latest Equation Hash from On-chain Events]
    E --> F[Generate Proof]

    G --> G1[Equation Hash == On-chain Hash]
    G --> G2[Secret is Root of Equation]

    G --> G4[Recompute Nullifier == Given Nullifier]

    G1 --> H[Proof Generated]
    G2 --> H
    G3 --> H
    G4 --> H

    H --> I[Prover Org Sends Nullifier and Proof to Verifier Org]
    I --> J{Nullifier Already Used?}
    J -- Yes --> K[Verification Already Done]
    J -- No --> L[On-chain Proof Verification]

    L --> M{Proof Valid?}
    M -- No --> N[Reject Verification]
    M -- Yes --> O[Cache Nullifier to Prevent Reverification]
    O --> P[Verification Successful]

    K --> E1[End]
    N --> E1
    P --> E1
```

### Security Constraints

-   **Polynomial Degree**: Maximum 128 coefficients per batch
-   **Batch Scaling**: Unlimited total members across multiple batches
-   **Hash Security**: Poseidon2 with 254-bit field elements
-   **Nullifier Uniqueness**: Deterministic per (secret, verifier_key) pair for verification caching
-   **KYC Enforcement**: Cryptographic compliance verification

## 🔐 Security Considerations

### Privacy Guarantees

-   **Zero-Knowledge**: No membership information is revealed
-   **Unlinkability**: Proofs cannot be linked to specific users
-   **Forward Secrecy**: Past proofs remain valid after member removal

### Attack Resistance

-   **Verification Caching**: Nullifiers prevent redundant verification overhead
-   **Polynomial Integrity**: Hash commitments ensure data authenticity
-   **KYC Bypass Prevention**: Cryptographic enforcement of compliance

### Audit Recommendations

1. Polynomial generation randomness quality
2. On-chain hash commitment verification
3. Nullifier storage and verification cache management
4. KYC integration security
